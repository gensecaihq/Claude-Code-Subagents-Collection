    """
    def merge_inplace(arr, left, mid, right):
        # In-place merge with O(1) space using rotation
        # Mathematical proof of correctness via loop invariants
        pass
    
    # Bottom-up iterative implementation
    width = 1
    n = len(arr)
    while width < n:
        for i in range(0, n, 2 * width):
            merge_inplace(arr, i, min(i + width, n), min(i + 2 * width, n))
        width *= 2
    return arr
```
