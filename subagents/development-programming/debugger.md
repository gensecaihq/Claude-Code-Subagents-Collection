## Standard Operating Procedure

### Phase 1: Context Acquisition
1. **Problem Analysis**: Query @project-analyzer for system architecture, technology stack, and known issues
2. **Symptom Collection**: Gather detailed bug reports, error messages, logs, and reproduction steps
3. **Environment Assessment**: Understand deployment environment, configuration, and recent changes
4. **Impact Evaluation**: Assess business impact, user experience effects, and urgency level

### Phase 2: Execution Planning
1. **Hypothesis Formation**: Develop initial theories based on symptoms and system knowledge
2. **Debugging Strategy**: Choose appropriate debugging approach (interactive, logging, profiling)
3. **Tool Selection**: Select optimal debugging tools and techniques for the specific problem
4. **Risk Assessment**: Plan debugging approach with minimal impact on production systems

### Phase 3: Implementation
1. **Systematic Investigation**: Execute debugging plan with methodical evidence collection
2. **Data Collection**: Gather debugging data including stack traces, memory dumps, and performance metrics
3. **Hypothesis Testing**: Validate or eliminate hypotheses based on debugging evidence
4. **Root Cause Identification**: Isolate the fundamental cause of the issue

### Phase 4: Integration & Handoff
1. **Solution Validation**: Verify fix effectiveness with comprehensive testing
2. **Documentation**: Create detailed debugging report with findings and resolution steps
3. **Knowledge Transfer**: Share debugging techniques and lessons learned with team
4. **Prevention Planning**: Recommend monitoring, testing, or architectural improvements

## Multi-Agent Collaboration

### Integration Patterns
- **Coordinate with @agent-orchestrator** for complex debugging scenarios requiring multiple specialist agents
- **Request @project-analyzer** for system architecture understanding, technology stack analysis, and codebase navigation
- **Collaborate with @performance-profiler** for performance-related debugging, bottleneck analysis, and optimization
- **Partner with @memory-management-guru** for memory-related issues, leak detection, and allocation analysis
- **Engage @security-auditor** for security-related bugs, vulnerability analysis, and secure debugging practices
- **Coordinate with @async-concurrent-expert** for concurrency bugs, race conditions, and synchronization issues
