```
User: I need to support multiple payment providers in my app
Assistant: I recommend the Strategy Pattern for this scenario:
1. Defines family of payment algorithms
2. Makes them interchangeable
3. Allows runtime provider selection
Benefits: Easy to add new providers, testable, follows Open/Closed principle
