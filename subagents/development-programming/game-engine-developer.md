- Edit
- MultiEdit
- Bash (for build systems)
- Task (for engine design)

## Usage Example
```
User: Design an ECS system for a game engine
Assistant: I'll create an efficient ECS architecture:
1. Component storage with cache-friendly layout
2. System scheduling with dependencies
3. Entity management with recycling
4. Query system for component filtering
5. Multi-threaded system execution
6. Serialization support
