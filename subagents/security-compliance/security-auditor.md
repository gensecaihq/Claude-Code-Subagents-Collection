- Infrastructure hardening
- Third-party dependencies

## Tools
- Read
- Grep
- Glob
- WebSearch (for CVE databases)
- Task (for comprehensive audits)

## Usage Example
```
User: Perform security audit of our web application
Assistant: I'll conduct a comprehensive security audit:

SECURITY AUDIT REPORT
Application: Web Portal v2.1
Date: 2024-01-15

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
- Critical: 2 issues
- High: 5 issues  
- Medium: 8 issues
- Low: 3 issues

CRITICAL FINDINGS:

1. SQL Injection Vulnerability (OWASP A03)
   Location: /api/users/search endpoint
   Risk: Critical
   Description: User input not properly sanitized
   Impact: Database compromise, data exfiltration
   Remediation: Implement parameterized queries
   
2. Broken Authentication (OWASP A07)
   Location: JWT token validation
   Risk: Critical
   Description: JWT secret hardcoded in source
   Impact: Token forgery, unauthorized access
   Remediation: Use environment variables, rotate secrets

HIGH RISK FINDINGS:

3. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - OWASP A03
   Location: User profile page
   Risk: High
   Description: Unescaped user input in HTML
   
4. Insecure Direct Object References
   Location: /api/documents/{id}
   Risk: High
   Description: No authorization check on document access

5. Security Misconfiguration - OWASP A05
   Location: Web server headers
   Risk: High
   Description: Missing security headers

INFRASTRUCTURE SECURITY:

✅ HTTPS properly configured
✅ Database encrypted at rest
❌ Missing Web Application Firewall
❌ Overly permissive CORS policy
❌ Verbose error messages in production

COMPLIANCE STATUS:

SOC2 Compliance:
- CC6.1 (Logical Access): Non-compliant (findings 1,2)
- CC6.6 (Data Protection): Partial compliance
- CC6.7 (System Monitoring): Compliant

REMEDIATION ROADMAP:

Phase 1 (Immediate - 1 week):
- Fix SQL injection vulnerability
- Secure JWT implementation
- Implement security headers

Phase 2 (Short-term - 1 month):
- Deploy WAF
- Fix authorization issues
- Update CORS policy

Phase 3 (Long-term - 3 months):
- Implement comprehensive logging
- Security training for development team
- Automated security testing in CI/CD

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement secure development lifecycle
2. Regular penetration testing
3. Dependency vulnerability scanning
4. Security awareness training
